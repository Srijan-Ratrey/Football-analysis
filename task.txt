Welcome to the AI Engineer hiring process at Future Sportler!
This document contains task options across team sports, allowing you to showcase your
ability to build video-based AI models for movement, tactical, and biomechanical
analysis.
Each candidate must select ONLY ONE of the following tasks and submit a working
model that:
•
Takes a video input
•
Performs pose estimation or detection
•
Outputs a 3D visualization video with insights and corrective feedback
Top-performing submissions may be selected for product development or patent filing
with full credit.
Choose ONE of the following sports tasks to proceed:

Task 3: Football – TacDcal & Technical Player EvaluaDon
Analyze a football (soccer) player's performance across movement, passing, and
defensive positioning.
Key components to analyze include:
•
Ball Control & Dribbling: Foot-to-ball contact consistency, touch frequency, dribble
path
•
Passing & Vision: Decision making based on teammate/defender layout, mispasses,
through balls
•
Shooting Mechanics: Body lean, hip torque, contact timing, follow-through angle
•
Defensive Play: Press timing, marking effectiveness, tackle posture
•
Positioning & Transitions: Role adaptability, tracking back, reaction post possession
loss
•
Set Piece Behavior: Movement during corners or free-kicks, marking assignments,
aerial duel posture
Reference Videos for EvaluaDon
Use the following video folder containing 5 videos for football analysis
